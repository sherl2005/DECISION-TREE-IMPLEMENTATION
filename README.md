## Description

This repository contains the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using **Scikit-learn** in **Google Colab** as part of my internship at **CodTech IT Solutions**. The primary objective of this task was to build and visualize a **Decision Tree model** for classification purposes.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset Used**: Mushroom Classification Dataset
- **Library Used**: `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values
  - Encoded categorical features
  - Split data into training and testing sets
- **Model Training**:
  - Used `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `Scikit-learn`
  - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy
- **Visualization**:
  - Visualized the Decision Tree using `graphviz` and `plot_tree()`
  - Plotted feature importance for better interpretability

## Output

Below are some visualizations from the implementation:

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decision-tree-implementation.git
   ```
2. Open the `Mushroom_Classification_DECISION_TREE_MODEL_USING_SCIKIT_LEARN.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
3. Run all the cells sequentially to execute the decision tree model.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn graphviz
```

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with implementing and tuning a **Decision Tree model**. The insights from feature importance and model visualization helped in understanding the classification process. Further improvements can be made by exploring **Random Forest** and **Ensemble Techniques**.
